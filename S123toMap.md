# Viewing Survey123 data in a map
> [!NOTE]
> Survey information can be found at the website [survey123.arcgis.com/surveys](survey123.arcgis.com/surveys)

## After creating a survey and obtaining the data, you can open a new map by:
1. Ensure you have clicked on the correct survey you wish to view the data for.
2. Once on the survey Overview page, click on the 'Data' tab on the top bar.
3. Click 'Open in Map Viewer' on the top bar.

## Once on the map viewer page, there are a few options.
### Quality Check (if location/a map was part of your survey):
Sometimes when maps are used within a survey to capture location data, the selected place/point when filling out the survey may not be entered correctly. 
To check thics, we can edit the style options of the layer to see if any points are unknowingly/incorrectly congregated.
1. With the survey data open in the map, and the data layer selected (will show blue), select the 'Properties' tab on the right side.
   If the peroperties cannot be seen, you can also select the 3 horizontal dots '...' beside the layer name and select 'Show properties'.
2. Under 'Pick a style', select 'Heat Map'.
3. Adjust the zoom to view all points and zoom in to congregated areas.

### Saving the map
1. Once you have set the desired layer properties, to save the map for future use select the 'Save and Open' icon on the left side, then click 'Save As'. 
2. This will then take you through the saving process and where you can then choose 'save'.
